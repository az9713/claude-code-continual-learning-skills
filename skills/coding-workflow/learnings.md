## [2025-12-30] - Embed URLs in markdown titles for better readability

**Context**: Updating README.md with reference documentation links
**Outcome**: Success
**Insight**: When adding URLs to documentation (especially credits, references, or resource sections), always use markdown embedded link format `[Descriptive Title](URL)` rather than displaying raw URLs in tables or inline. This improves readability in both rendered and raw markdown views.
**Solution**: Changed from table with raw URLs to bullet list with embedded links:
- Before: `| Skills Documentation | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills |`
- After: `- [Skills Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)`
**Tags**: #documentation #markdown #best-practices #readability
